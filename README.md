

Orca is a yet another Object Oriented Programming language. 
It is made by C++/STL/BOOST so core source is extremely small, efficient and easily bind with C++ class.

orca is now developed at 

https://github.com/orca-lang


# BUILD

in unix-like systems (actually, I tested it on linux only)

./autogen.sh
./configure
make
make install

refer BUILD for more reuqired library and info.


Windows build is now broken, but It'll be fixed as soon as possible.



# TEST

type on console 'orca tests/test'
and you can see the execution result of test.orca which is located in tests directory.
or just type 'orca' invokes interpreter.

another documents are will be posted soon.
